# Bird Monitoring Project

## 📌 Overview
The Bird Monitoring Project analyzes bird species observation data to extract insights for conservation, biodiversity management, and ecological assessments. It leverages **Power BI** for visualization and **Python** for data preprocessing, providing data-driven insights into species diversity, habitat distribution, and environmental influences.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Endangered Species**: 378 species identified; conservation risk scores calculated per site.
- **Habitat Distribution**: Forest (50.04%) and Grassland (49.96%) observations.
- **Species Diversity**: 127 unique species; most observed: **Northern Cardinal, Carolina Wren, Red-eyed Vireo**.
- **Environmental Impact**: Sightings decline with serious disturbances; influenced by temperature & humidity.
- **Temporal Trends**: Peak sightings in **morning hours**; seasonal variations in patterns.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards & geospatial mapping.
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data preprocessing & analysis.
- **Geospatial Analysis** – Identifying endangered species hotspots.
