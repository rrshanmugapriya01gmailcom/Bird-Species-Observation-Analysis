# Bird Monitoring Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Bird Monitoring Project** analyzes bird species observation data to derive meaningful insights for conservation efforts, biodiversity management, and ecological assessments. This project leverages **Power BI** for visualization, Python for data preprocessing, and various analytical techniques to extract trends from bird sighting patterns, environmental factors, and conservation risks.

## 📊 Key Insights
- **Endangered Species Analysis**
  - 378 species identified as endangered.
  - Conservation risk score calculated for different sites.
  
- **Habitat Distribution**
  - Birds observed across Forest (50.04%) and Grassland (49.96%) regions.
  
- **Species Diversity & Popularity**
  - 127 unique species recorded.
  - Most frequently observed species: *Northern Cardinal, Carolina Wren, Red-eyed Vireo.*
  
- **Environmental Impact on Bird Population**
  - Observations affected by temperature, humidity, and disturbance levels.
  - Serious disturbances lead to a decline in sightings.
  
- **Observer Influence & Time-based Trends**
  - Bird sightings vary by time of day, with peak activity around morning hours.
  - Seasonal trends show variations in sighting patterns across months.
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Power BI** – Interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Geospatial Mapping** – Identifying hotspots for endangered species.
