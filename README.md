# Bird Monitoring Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Bird Monitoring Project** analyzes bird species observation data to derive meaningful insights for conservation efforts, biodiversity management, and ecological assessments. This project leverages **Power BI** for visualization, Python for data preprocessing, and various analytical techniques to extract trends from bird sighting patterns, environmental factors, and conservation risks.

## 📊 Key Insights
1. **Endangered Species Analysis**
   - **378 species** identified as endangered.
   - **Conservation risk score** calculated for different sites.
   
2. **Habitat Distribution**
   - Birds observed across **Forest (50.04%)** and **Grassland (49.96%)** regions.
   
3. **Species Diversity & Popularity**
   - **127 unique species** recorded.
   - Most frequently observed species: *Northern Cardinal, Carolina Wren, Red-eyed Vireo.*
   
4. **Environmental Impact on Bird Population**
   - Observations affected by **temperature, humidity, and disturbance levels**.
   - Serious disturbances lead to a decline in sightings.
   
5. **Observer Influence & Time-based Trends**
   - Bird sightings vary by time of day, with peak activity around **morning hours**.
   - **Seasonal trends** show variations in sighting patterns across months.
   
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Power BI** – Interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – Data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Geospatial Mapping** – Identifying hotspots for endangered species.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Implement **Machine Learning** models for predicting bird sighting trends.
- Advanced geospatial analysis for **eco-tourism & urban planning insights**.
- Develop a **Streamlit web app** for real-time bird monitoring.
